# Inspiring-writings
Several times a week, I read articles I find inspiring. This repos is a collection of some of those writings. A good deal of them are related to the subject of hardwork, discipline, success. Others are purely philosophical. 

## On careers
[1] [Top Performers are Pathologically Ambitious](https://thatvastvariety.substack.com/p/top-performers-are-pathologically)
A quote from this: 
  > "There is a massive gap between the average person’s level of ambition and those of top performers. Until you’ve seen it up close or read a few biographies, it’s hard to realize the pathological urge some people feel to improve their skills, to set absurd goals, and to do what’s necessary to achieve them."
